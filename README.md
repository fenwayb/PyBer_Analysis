  PyBer Analysis

  # Overview
  
  <p>For this project we were tasked with using Python with the MatPlotLib and Pandas libraries to create useful visualizations for data from a ride-sharing app called PyBer.</p>
  
  ## Results
![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106105597/180324796-9ef279b1-9476-4a35-bafa-06970a889d85.png)
<p> These pie charts show the disparity between the % of total fares, % of total rides, and % of total drivers between urban, rural, and suburban areas</p>

<p>This chart shows that urban rides make up the largest portion of total fares while rural rides make up a very small portion. At its peak rural fares make five times less money than urban rides do.</p>

<p> This dataframe shows:
  
  ***
  * The total rides by area type
  * the total drivers by area type
  * Total fares by area type
  * Average fare per ride by area type
  * Average fare per driver by area type</p>
  
    
  # Summary
  <p>There are a number of useful conclusions that can be made based on these graphs. 
  
  ***
  1. Urban areas make up the majority of this apps business in rides, drivers, and total fares. PyBer should continue to focus in urban areas as they make such a large portion of their money from them.
  2. There is a potential untapped market of suburban drivers, as they make up 30.5% of the fares and 26.3% of the rides but only  16.5% of the drivers. PyBer could potentially grow by encouraging more suburban drivers
  3. There are potentially too many urban drivers, creating internal competition and causing urban fare prices to make up less of the total fares than it does for rides and drivers. This might balance itself out by virtue of supply and demand but it is something to keep an eye out for. </p>
